## HW1: Stack
### Problem 1: Implement the following functions of the stack.
    * push(): Put the data in the top of the stack.
    * pop(): Delete the data in the top of the stack.
    * top(): View the data in the top of the stack.
### Problem 2: Largest Rectangular Area of Buildings
    * Today, school wants to make a huge advertising banner. Thus, we need to find out the largest rectangular area of buildings. The height of banner should not exceed any of buildings.

## HW2: Dynamic Programming
This programming assignment asks you to compute how many ways a string composed of digits can be divided into integers (“n1, n2, ..., nk”) ranging from 0 to 100 (0 ≤ ni ≤ 100, i = 1, 2, ..., k). For example, the digit string “21005” can be divided into “2,1,0,0,5”, “21,0,0,5”, “2,10,0,5”, or “2,100,5”, and thus there are 4 ways to divide the string. Note that 0-leading numbers (except for 0 itself) are not allowed. For example, “2,10,05” is not allowed due to the leading zero in “05”.

## HW3: Binary Search Tree (BST)
This programming assignment asks you to check if a given sequence can be a preorder or a postorder traversal of a BST. If yes, please find the another way to traverse the corresponding BST.

## HW4: Priority Queue
This programming assignment asks you to implement a priority queue by a binary heap. The input contains three commands as follows:
    * insert x: insert the number x into the heap.
    * deleteMin: delete the minimum key from the heap. 
    * findMin: find the minimum key in the heap. (Note that when findMin is performed, you should store the returned value.)

## HW5: Sorting
Given a number K and a set of integer values, what is the minimum difference between the maximum and the minimum of all possible K-element subsets?
